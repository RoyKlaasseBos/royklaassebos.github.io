            <p>Characteristic of Kevin’s teaching style is a step by step approach using very detailed Jupyter Notebooks which contain a lot of comments and easy-to-understand explanations and thus makes it excellent reference material (check out his Github page!).  Because he explains every single line of code he types you will fully understand what you are doing which makes his videos accessible to newcomers. Although most videos stay at a basic level plenty of additional resources (blogs/videos/books) are included and mentioned throughout the videos series for further deepening.</p>
            <p><i>Tip 1:</i> Adjust the playback speed to 1.5x or 2.0x (via the gear icon in the play bar) to go through the videos more quickly!<br/>
            <i>Tip 2:</i> The last video in the series is a live recording from PyCon 2016; if you have watched the previous videos you can skip the first 24 minutes and start with part 2: Representing text as numerical data.</p>

         <p>Once you have seen how to work with Matplotlib it’s a piece of cake, but first use can be intimidating. Max does a great job in his brief and easy-to-follow tutorials which give you a good introduction to the basic functionality of Matplotlib. By the way, he offers the exact same content on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/making-graphs-in-python-using-matplotlib-for-beginners/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> for $20, lucky you!</p>
         <p><i>Tip:</i> there is a bit of overlap with the previous recommendation (Axes, Histogram), though the majority of the content covers different aspects. Besides, it doesn't hurt to hear a similar story from two angles.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h4><i>There are plenty of "Top Data Science Course" rankings out there, how is this one any different?</i></h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Well, I have looked into plenty of those rankings myself but most MOOC-recommendations weren't really what I was looking for as a beginner to be honest. This guide is different in the sense that it mainly centres around practical YouTube tutorials taught by industry practitioners who really master the craft of teaching. The latter is a rare ability for most programmers, especially those who can describe the "why" in addition to the "how"; simply typing out code is not that difficult, explaining others in plain English why you are doing something makes you a next-level instructor. Lastly, all recommendations are accompanied with an overview of the contents and a review - so that you can get an idea of what to expect - which is also not very common for most rankings.</p>



    <h4><i>The curriculum does not include any R videos (only Python). Why is that?</i></h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Very sharp, you are absolutely right! One of the questions people new to the field of data science typically ask themselves is: should I learn Python or R? If you simply Google <a href="http://bfy.tw/FnTe" target="_blank">"Python vs R for Data Science"</a> you will find an abundance of discussions on this topic. From what I've read Python usually comes out as the ultimate winner (especially for Deep Learning applications - a subset of Machine Learning that tries to mimic the human brain). That does not mean that you should neglect R of course, but as a beginner I think it's better to become very knowledgeable in a single programming language rather than be mediocre at two.</p>



    <h4><i>What makes a Data Science unicorn?</i> 🦄</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>In the beginning of this academic year I interviewed a professor, Willem-Jan van der Heuvel, and that was also one of the questions I asked him. In summary he mentioned the following skills: <i>"Analytical Skills"</i> (e.g. Statistics & Probability), <i>"Engineering Skills"</i> (e.g. Programming but, for example, also distributed computing frameworks) and third: <i>"Domain Knowledge"</i> (e.g. a subversion expert). If you are interested, you can read the corresponding Medium article <a href="https://medium.com/the-outlier/willem-jan-van-den-heuvel-91af6c86dcda" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



    <h4><i>How do I become a Data Science unicorn?</i></h4>
    <hr>
    <p>That is the logical follow-question obviously. First, let me say that I am not the one to answer that question, hence I will share the advice I got from data people way smarter and more experienced than me to answer a slightly rephrased question: <i>What is the best way to learn data science?</i></p>

    <p>If you look into the week by week schedule of data science (and coding) bootcamps, you will find that the last weeks of the program are usually dedicated towards students' capstone projects. That are learning projects which entail all steps of the  data science pipeline: from data collection to presenting to the end customer. Because of this scope students experience all the tasks involved in a everyday and thus representative data science project. This typically implies you spend the majority of your time wrangling and cleaning the data (because remember: on average data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning the data). On that note, some folks aren't that keen on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> competitions (i.e. machine learning model building contests); since most data sets available on the platform have already been fully cleaned. But the main take-away here is to think of any topic you like (and in which you preferably have some kind of subject matter expertise) and work from there. After all, data is everywhere these days so it should not be that difficult to think of intriguing research questions related to your interests.</p>

    <p>On a personal note, I would add that while watching tutorials on YouTube you may sometimes get the impression that you  master the material. I want to warn you against that false impression because in my opinion coding something from scratch is significantly harder than retyping (or even worse: copy pasting) someone's else code. A better measure to test your understanding is by applying your knowledge in a completely different environment (e.g. a side-project as mentioned above).</p>



    <h4><i>What does "Upvotes" mean and how is it calculated?</i></h4>
    <hr>
    <p>On Coursera, edX and Udemy course ratings are displayed as a star rating (between 0-5 stars). On YouTube there is a similar mechanism to measure user feedback: up- and downvotes. A derivative thereof, the upvote ratio: #upvotes/(#upvotes + #downvotes) * 100%, has been included for each of my recommendations (calculated for the first video of the series). </p>

    <p>Note that, I deliberately did not take into account total number of views neither the subscriber count since there are a wealth of hidden gems out there which - as the name implies - are still relatively unknown.. 💎</p>



    <h4><i>The title says "Top Data Science Videos 2018" but some of the content originates from way before 2018, isn't it?</i></h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Yeah again, you are right! Think of it as a catchy slogan ;-)</p>



    <h4><i>Where do I find the lecture notes of the Data Analytics for Engineers (2IAB0) tutorials?</i></h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Great to have you here, but you are probably looking for my Github repository which you can find <a href="https://github.com/RoyKlaasseBos/Data-Analytics-for-Engineers" target="_blank">over here</a>. Simply, download the zip-file (easiest way) or clone it to your local hard drive (for instructions on how to do that see the Git tutorials above).
    </p>
    <p>But since you are already here, let me give you another bonus tip: carefully study the Python and pandas tutorials listed above. I can ensure you they will be extremely helpful for assignment 1 and 2!</p>



    <h4><i>Is this guide updated regularly?</i></h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Indeed, it's a very dynamic list. For example, at the moment of writing I am taking online (and university) courses myself which means that there is a high probability that the number of "free resources" will soon increase even further.. ;-)</p>



    <h4><i>Can I contribute to this list and if so how?</i></h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Yes, you can! To add a recommendation to the list, fork this <a href="https://github.com/RoyKlaasseBos/royklaassebos.github.io" target="_blank">repository</a>, update the README markdown file while maintaining the structure of the page and lastly create a pull request in which you briefly mention the change. Alternatively, send me an 💌 (see below).</p>
