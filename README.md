<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>There are plenty of "Top Data Science Course" lists out there, how is this one any different?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Well, I have looked at plenty of those lists myself but most of their online course (MOOC) recommendations weren't really what I was looking for to be honest. This guide is different in the sense that it mainly centres around practical YouTube tutorials taught by industry practitioners who really master the craft of teaching. The latter is a rare ability for many programmers, especially those who can describe the "why" in addition to the "how"; simply typing out code is not that difficult, explaining others in plain English why you are doing something is much more challenging. Lastly, all recommendations are accompanied with a textual review which is also not very common for most rankings.</p>

<h4>The curriculum does not include any R videos. Why is that?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Very sharp, you are absolutely right! One of the questions people new to the field of data science typically come up with is: should I learn Python or R? If you simply Google "Python vs R for Data Science" you will find an abundance of discussions on this topic. From what I've read Python usually comes out as the ultimate winner (especially for Deep Learning applications - a subset of Machine Learning that tries to mimic the human brain). That does not mean that you should neglect R of course, but as a beginner I think it's better to become very knowledgeable at a single programming language rather than be mediocre at two.</p>

<h4>What makes a Data Science unicorn?</h4>
<hr>
<p>In the beginning of this academic year I interviewed a professor, Willem-Jan van der Heuvel, and that was also one of the questions I asked him. In summary he mentions the following skills: <i>"Analytical skills"</i> (e.g. Statistics & Probability), <i>"Engineering Skills"</i> (e.g. Programming but, for example, also distributed computing frameworks) and third: <i>"Domain Knowledge"</i> (e.g. a subversion expert). If you are interested, you can read the corresponding article <a href="https://medium.com/the-outlier/willem-jan-van-den-heuvel-91af6c86dcda" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4>How do I become a Data Science unicorn?</h4>
<hr>
<p>That is the logical follow-question obviously. First, let me say that I am not the one to answer that question, hence I will share the advice I got from data people way smarter and more experienced than me to answer the (slightly rephrased) question: <i>What is the Best Way to Learn Data Science?</i></p>
  
<p>If you look into the week by week schedule of data science (and coding) bootcamps, you will find that the last weeks of the program are usually dedicated towards students' capstone projects. That are learning projects which entail all steps from the complete data science pipeline: from data collection to presenting to the end customer. Because of this scope students experience all the tasks involved in a everyday and thus representative data science project. This typically implies you spend the majority of your time wrangling and cleaning the data (because remember: on average data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning the data). On that note, some folks do not really like Kaggle challenges as much; since most data sets available on the platform are already fully cleaned. But the main take-away here is to think of any topic you like (and in which you preferably have some kind of subject matter expertise) and work from there. After all, data is everywhere these days so it should not be that difficult to think of interesting research questions.</p>
  
<p>On a personal note, I would add that while watching tutorials on YouTube you may sometimes get the impression that you really master the material. I want to warn you against that false impression, because coding something from scratch is significantly harder than retyping (or even worse: copy pasting) someone's else code. A better measure to test your understanding is by applying your knowledge in a completely different environment (e.g. a side-project as mentioned above).</p>
 
<h4>What does "Upvotes" mean?</h4>
<hr>
<p>On Coursera, edX and Udemy course ratings are displayed as a star rating (between 0-5 stars). On YouTube there is a similar mechanism to measure user feedback: up- and downvotes. A derivative thereof, the upvote ratio #upvotes/(#upvotes + #downvotes) * 100%, is shown for each of my recommendations. <br/>
  
Note that, I explicitly did not take into account views neither subscriber count since there are a wealth of hidden gems out there which - as the name implies - are still relatively unknown.. 💎</p>

<h4>The title says "Top Data Science Videos 2018" but some of the content originates from way before 2018, isn't it?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Yeah again, you are right! Think of it as a catchy marketing slogan ;-)</p>

<h4>Where do I find the lecture notes of the Data Analytics for Engineers (2IAB0) tutorials?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Great to have you here, but you are probably looking for my Github repository which you can find <a href="https://github.com/RoyKlaasseBos/Data-Analytics-for-Engineers" target="_blank">over here</a>. Simply, download the zip-file (easiest way) or clone it to your local hard drive (for instructions on how to do that see the Git tutorials above :-)
</p>
<p>But since you are already here, let me give you another bonus tip: carefully study the Python and pandas tutorials listed above. I can ensure you they will be extremely helpful for assignment 1 and 2!</p>

<h4>Is this guide updated regularly?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Indeed, it's a very dynamic list. For example, at the moment of writing I am taking online (and university) courses myself which means that there is a high probability that the number of "free resources" will soon increase even more.. ;-)</p>

<h4>Can I contribute to this list and if so how?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Yes, you can! To add a recommendation to the list, fork this <a href="https://github.com/RoyKlaasseBos/royklaassebos.github.io" target="_blank">repository</a>, update the README markdown file while maintaining the structure of the page and lastly create a pull request in which you briefly mention the change. Alternatively, send me an email (see below).</p>

<h4>How do I contact you?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Just shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:r.j.klaasse.bos@student.tue.nl">r.j.klaasse.bos@student.tue.nl</a></p>
